# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning techniques. The model takes various concrete mixture features, such as cement, water, and aggregate components, as input and outputs a predicted strength value. The goal is to assist in optimizing concrete mixture designs for engineering purposes.

Dataset
The dataset used contains concrete samples with the following features:
Cement
Blast Furnace Slag
Fly Ash
Water
Superplasticizer
Coarse Aggregate
Fine Aggregate
Age (days)
The target variable is the compressive strength of the concrete (in MPa).
Machine Learning Process

Data Preprocessing

Load and clean the dataset, ensuring that there are no missing values or outliers.
Normalize or standardize the data to improve model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Analyze the relationships between the input features and the target variable.
Visualize the data using plots like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

Model Selection

Choose suitable regression algorithms for predicting concrete strength, such as:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
Training the Model

Train the selected models on the training dataset.
Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation to improve accuracy.
Model Evaluation

Test the models on the test dataset and evaluate performance using metrics like:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²) score
